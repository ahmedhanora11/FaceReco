**I know who you are!**

> OVERVIEW

Face-Reco is a real-time face recognition application developed to detect and identify individuals using facial features captured through a camera feed. Using technologies such as the face_recognition library and OpenCV, Face-Reco provides a user-friendly interface for instant face recognition and confidence level estimation. The application processes live video streams, identifies faces, matches them against known individuals, and displays their names along with a confidence level.

> KEY FEATURES
- Real-time Face Detection: Face-Reco captures live video feeds and uses advanced face detection techniques to accurately locate faces within the frame.

- Face Recognition: The application encodes detected faces and matches them against a database of known faces using facial encodings. It provides the name of the recognized person and an associated confidence level.

- Confidence Level Display: Face-Reco not only identifies individuals but also assesses the confidence level of the match, allowing users to gauge the accuracy of the recognition.

- User-friendly Interface: The application features an intuitive and easy-to-use graphical interface that displays the video feed, detected faces, recognized names, and confidence levels.

- Customization: Users can add their own known faces to the application by placing images in the designated "faces" folder. The application then uses these images to build a reference database for recognition.

- Resizable Face Rectangles: The application visually highlights recognized faces by drawing rectangles around them. Users can customize the size of these rectangles to emphasize recognized faces effectively.

#Note: Face-Reco requires the installation of necessary libraries, such as dlib, face_recognition, and OpenCV,  to function properly.
